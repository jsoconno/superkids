        kidInstructions: "Time to be The Flash! First, warm up by jogging in place for 30 seconds. Then, when your parent says 'Flash GO!', run as fast as you can to your marker, touch it, and walk back slowly to catch your breath. Each time you run, make a whoosh sound like you're breaking the speed barrier! Can you do it 5 times?",
        parentInstructions: "Set up two markers about 20 feet apart using anything safe (cones, stuffed animals, etc.). Create a fun starting line with tape. Time each sprint and encourage beating personal records. Make it exciting by using phrases like 'Breaking the speed barrier!' or 'New speed record!'. Watch for signs of tiredness and ensure water breaks. For variety, add fun challenges like 'run like you're saving someone' or 'run while carrying your favorite stuffed animal to safety.'",

Can you make your own power pose before each throw?",
        parentInstructions: "Use a soft rope or jump rope (about 4-6 feet long). Start with large targets (laundry baskets or boxes) and make them smaller as skill improves. Create a story where each target is a 'villain' that needs to be caught. Draw or print simple villain faces to stick on targets. Teach proper throwing technique: step forward with opposite foot, swing arm back, then forward. Make it more fun by having targets at different heights or distances. Celebrate successful catches with a Wonder Woman power pose together!",

Draw spider webs on the targets for extra fun. Start close to targets (3-4 feet) and gradually increase distance. Make it engaging by creating scenarios: 'Oh no, Doc Ock is getting away!' or 'Green Goblin is up high!'. Track successful hits with a simple scorecard.

Use a very stable, low platform (6 inches max) like a sturdy step or thick foam block. Start with practicing poses on the ground - make it fun by naming them ('The Iron Man,' 'The Black Panther'). Teach proper landing technique: bend knees, land softly on whole foot, arms out for balance. Stand close and spot them, keeping hands ready to support. Progress through levels: 1) Step and pose (no jump), 2) Small hop and pose, 3) Platform jump and pose. Create a scoring system for style points: +1 for knee bend, +1 for cool pose, +1 for smooth landing. Take photos of their best poses (if possible) to show them their progress.
